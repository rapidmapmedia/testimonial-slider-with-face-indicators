# testimonial-slider-with-face-indicators
Coding for testimonial slider with face profile for indicators. 

Required:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery

Implemented this code snippet into ClickFunnels for www.metamo.com and www.connectorsacademy.com

Notes:
In ClickFunnels, the following link tag is already implemented so it is not required.
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css&quot;&gt;

However the compiled and minified bootstrap for CSS was breaking the width layout of the clickFunnel pages being created. Omitting the following link tag resolved this layout issue.
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;&gt;
