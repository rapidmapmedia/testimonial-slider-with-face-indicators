# testimonial-slider-with-face-indicators
Coding for testimonial slider with face profile for indicators. 

Preview code - http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rapidmapmedia/testimonial-slider-with-face-indicators/blob/master/index.html

<strong>Required:</strong><br>
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery

Implemented this code snippet into ClickFunnels for www.metamo.com and www.connectorsacademy.com

<strong>Notes:</strong><br>
In ClickFunnels, the following link tag is already implemented so it is not required.<br>
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
```
However the compiled and minified bootstrap for CSS was breaking the width layout of the clickFunnel pages being created. Omitting the following link tag resolved this layout issue.<br>
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css">
```
